assignment: cs108 hw2 - part 2

notes:
I included a simple extension that performs the opposite function of the adversary, giving you
pieces that leave fewer holes.  I mainly did this because the brain loses too easily, and so
giving it an extra little foresight helps it last longer.  There is an extra slider that 
varies the randomness of the friend.  The way it determines which piece to drop is somewhat
but not too convoluted, and documented in the function itself.  I think 10 / 30  on the adversary
/ friend sliders makes the game last a while.

It would have been cool to try out AI, but I do not enjoy programming in Java enough :(.
