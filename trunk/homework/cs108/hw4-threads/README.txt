hw4 - threads

notes:
Javadoc is included for a lot of the assignment.

For Part A, I assumed the transaction count should be incremented for both the
withdrawled account and deposited account, not just the withdrawled.

Notes about Testing:
It is very difficult to code that uses concurrency heavily.  I did not try to do
anything fancy.  I did, however, create some unit tests for code that uses threads.
I also created a ruby script that tests the cracker code.
